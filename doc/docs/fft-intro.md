Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
===

Fast Fourier transform is a very significant algorithm for signaling and polynomial, etc.
Madd provides FFT functions for general usages on different platforms.

**INVITATIONS!**: I had already considered to call the functions in `FFTW3` library since it has the best optimizations.
However, `FFTW3` applies the GPL open source license, which conflicts with Madd.
Therefore, I have to realize FFT with my limited knowledges.
If you have interest in **optimizing the FFT functions in Madd**, I will be very glad to add your name to the author list.
